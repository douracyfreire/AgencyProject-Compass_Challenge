# Agency Project: Web Page Creation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This repository contains the solution developed for the challenge proposed in week 04, aiming to apply and enhance skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project consists of creating **Login**, **Home**, and **Create Account** (the latter being optional) pages for an agency.

## üöÄ Project Description
The project simulates a simple authentication system with login functionalities. Additionally, it includes the use of data contained in a JSON file (**data.json**), which are dynamically displayed on the Home page and shown in a modal view when clicked.

### Main Features
- **Login Page**: Allows the user to input their credentials to access the Home page.
- **Home Page**: Displays data loaded from a JSON file and presents it dynamically in a modal (pop-up).
- **Create Account Page**: Displays information indicating that this page‚Äôs functionality is under construction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic page structuring.
- **CSS3**: Styling and visual layout organization.
- **JavaScript**: Validation logic and handling data from a JSON file.
